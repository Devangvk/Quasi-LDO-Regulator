# Quasi-LDO-Regulator
Designed the LDO with output voltage of 12V @ 1A                                                                                                                         
The regulator is designed with an intent of using it along with pre tracking switching regulator having output voltage of 15V with peak ripple voltage of 250mV                   
Schematic is given below:
